# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, class, sex, and fare. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model assists in understanding factors that contributed to survival outcomes.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast passenger survival on the Titanic. This involves:

- Analyzing the provided dataset.
- Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Building and training a machine learning model.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devanshidudhatra/Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Project.git
   cd Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Project
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, please refer to the import statements in `survival.ipynb` to install the required libraries.*

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook survival.ipynb
   ```

   This will open the notebook in your browser, where you can follow the steps for data analysis and model building.
